# Arduino_To_WinDaq Chart Recorder
Originated from our DI-188, this open source project turns any **Arduino速** (Arduino Zero is used here) or **Arduino速-compatible** module such as DI-188 to a [WinDaq](https://www.dataq.com/products/windaq/)-based data acquisition chart recorder. It supports up to 16 analog channels (4 analog channels is demonstrated in the source codes) to accept readings from on-board ADC or sensors connected to grove connectors. **It supports WinDaq addons like [FFT, Spectrogram, Smart Meters, Gauge display, various trigger modes, calculated channel](http://www.ultimaserial.com/wdspectrum.html), [XY plot](https://www.dataq.com/products/windaq/add_ons/index.htm), and [Excel link](https://www.dataq.com/products/windaq/windaqxl/product.html),**

**To use the project:**
1) Please [follow this instruction](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software#experimental-software) to install Arduino IDE 2.0.  
2) If you don't use DI-188, which is based on Seeeduino XIAO, jump to step 3)
    -  [Follow this instruction](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/#:~:text=Install%20it.&text=After%20installing%20the%20board%2C%20click,the%20Tools%20%7C%20Serial%20Port%20menu. ) to allow XIAO to be added to Arduino IDE search engine
    - Restart Arduino IDE to allow XIAO to be added to the search engine
    - From ArduinoIDE->Tools->Boards->Board Manager, type in XIAO or Arduino Zero and let IDE download all libraries for your module
       - When you upgrade Arduino IDE, you may need to upgrade the libraries as well
    - Select ArduinoIDE->Tools->Boards->Seeed SAMD boards->Seeeduino XIAO  
    - You may also need to specify the COM port for the module
3) Install Flash library
    - Visit https://github.com/cmaglie/FlashStorage
    - Push Code button and select Download ZIP
    - From Arduino IDE, follow ArduinoIDE->Sketch->Include Library->Add ZIP Library... to add the downloaded library from above step
4) Restart Arduino IDE 
5) Now you can compile and upload the firmware
6) To download WinDaq, please click [www.dataq.com](https://www.dataq.com/products/windaq/). WinDaq is a proprietary commercial software from DATAQ, and it allows free personal home use only under this Arduino project.

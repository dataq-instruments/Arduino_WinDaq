# Arduino_To_WinDaq
This is an open source project that can make any Arduino® or Arduino®-compatible module (Seeed Studio's Seeeduino XIAO is used as our first example) to stream analog waveforms to WinDaq. It supports up to 16 analog channels (4 analog channels is demonstrated with XIAO) to accept readings from on-board ADC or sensors connected to grove connectors

This is an on-going project, final Windaq support has not been released yet

External library is needed to build the sketch, download the zip file and import to Arduino IDE

Make sure to use the latest DICOM100.EXE

DICOMMNT.EXE needs to set RTS and DTE true to make serial class under Arduino® work

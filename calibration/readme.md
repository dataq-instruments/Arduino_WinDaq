An utility to calibrate the offset and scale of DI-188

To calibrate offset, all you need is to short all inputs on DI-188 and run the app

After that, if you have a good voltage source beteween 8.5-9.5V, you can continue to calibrate the scale

To calibrate scale, connect the voltage source to ALL channels, enter it to the app and continue

An utility to calibrate the offset and scale of DI-188

1. First enter the COM port to the text box
2. To calibrate offset, short all inputs on DI-188
3. Click the button "Start to calibrate"
4. Once the app collect 50 sects of data, it will pause and calibrate the offset of DI-188
5. After that, if you have a good voltage source beteween 8.5-9.5V, you can continue to calibrate the scale. Otherwise, you can terminate the program and leave the scale to default
6. To calibrate scale, connect the voltage source to ALL channels, enter it to the text box to the right
7. Click the button "Start to calibrate"
8. Once the app collect 50 sects of data, it will pause and calibrate the scale of DI-188
9. If the scaling is outside of the range, the software will reject the result
